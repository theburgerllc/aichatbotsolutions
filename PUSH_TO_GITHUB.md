## 🔐 Authentication Options

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

2. **Push with token:**
   ```bash
   # Use your token as the password when prompted
   git push -u origin main
   # Username: theburgerllc
   # Password: [PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE]
   ```

   Or set it permanently:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://theburgerllc:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/theburgerllc/aichatbotsolutions.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

# For Windows/WSL:
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
